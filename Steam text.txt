V7 ready/ fixed! 
Whenever short on power, this is the easiest fix. You found my Powered by Nature mod. 

Put up a windmill. One windmill powers one silicon smelter. Just stick it next to it and you are up and running. You can have a whole windmill park to power everything. 

Windmill = 30 power units per second
Bigger windmill = 210 power units per second
Wind turbine = 420 power units per second
The water dam requires graphite and water, but then runs on 1080 power units per second. 
Just make sure it has enough water :D 

Added a Windmill park, more expensive, but gives 1380 power units per second

3 powernodes are added for bigger range and 2 larger batteries to store all extra power. 

With the new V7 added weather sometimes you will get less power. 
They are modeled after solar panels and need sun. The game has no 'wind'. 

All feedback is nice, this is my first solo mod and Iâ€™m eager to learn.
